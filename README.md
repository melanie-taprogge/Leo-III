Leo-III
========
*An automated theorem prover for classical higher-order logic with choice*

Leo-III [SB19,S18,SB18] is an automated theorem prover for (polymorphic) higher-order logic which supports all common TPTP dialects, including THF, TFF and FOF as well as their rank-1 polymorphic derivatives [Sut08,SWB17]. 
It is based on a paramodulation calculus with ordering constraints and, in tradition of its predecessor LEO-II [BP15], heavily relies on cooperation with external (mostly first-order) theorem provers for increased performance. Nevertheless, Leo-III can also be used as a stand-alone prover without employing any external cooperation.

In addition for its HOL reasoning capabilities, Leo-III supports reasoning in many higher-order quantified modal logics [GS18,GSB17].

Leo-III was initially developed at Freie Universität Berlin, and then at University of Luxembourg (until 2021). From 2014 - 2018, it was supported by the German National Research Foundation (DFG) under project BE 2501/11-1 (Leo-III). Since 2022, Leo-III is maintained and developed at the University of Greifswald, Germany. The main contributors are (sorted alphabetically): Christoph Benzmüller, Alexander Steen and Max Wisniewski. For a full list of contributors to the project and used and third-party libraries, please refer to the `AUTHORS` file in the source distribution.

## Install
Leo-III is written in the Scala programming language. It can be installed quite simply using the sbt build tool. Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to details.

## Usage
Leo-III runs on the JVM and accepts pretty much every [TPTP input dialect](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/TR/TPTPTR.shtml) (e.g. FOF, TFF, THF) but it's mainly focused on reasoning in classical higher-order logic represented as THF. See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for details for its usage.
